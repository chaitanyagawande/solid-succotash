## Projects

### 1. Dimensionality Reduction üìâ

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CVAkogTmMPhA_a7I4p8Oy9LRKEQq1jIT#scrollTo=gPI0YBC1Gd_K)

This project demonstrates the application of Dimensionality Reduction techniques on a complex dataset. The main goal is to reduce the number of features while retaining the essential information, thereby simplifying the model without significant loss of information.

#### Key Techniques:
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

This project extends the dimensionality reduction approach by integrating clustering algorithms. Post-dimensionality reduction, the dataset is subjected to clustering to identify inherent groupings within the data.

#### Key Techniques:
- PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- K-Means Clustering

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction Technique using Databricks üåü

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uP-aE751u0xck-Xhci2NzD87IpX6dUz2#scrollTo=iyY_09gYZTz-)

A specialized project that leverages the power of Databricks for Dimensionality Reduction. This project showcases how Databricks can be effectively utilized for handling large-scale data and complex computations.

#### Key Techniques:
- Integration with Databricks
- Advanced Dimensionality Reduction
